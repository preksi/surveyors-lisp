# surveyors-lisp
AutoCAD (and compatible apps) LISPs for land surveyors, but can come in handy for anyone else ;-)

## Sources
Some of these LISPs are based on other people's work, but the original were aquired a long time ago (20+ years) so I'm not sure which files are in question, and who was the original author. If anybody recognizes their own work here, please let me know so that you can be properly credited.
